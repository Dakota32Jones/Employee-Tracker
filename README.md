# Employee-Tracker

## Description

Here is an application that takes in user input to populate a table for an employee tracker database. This helps keep track of employees within a company for a user to see in an organized format. This shows my ability on how to use dependencies, use CRUD mechanisms to change data and the ability to take in a user input.
